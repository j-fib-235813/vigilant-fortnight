## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Module not found" errors**
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. **Image upload fails**
   - Check file size (max 32MB)
   - Verify file format is supported
   - Ensure uploads directory has write permissions

3. **Database errors**
   - Delete `needlepoint.db` and restart the application
   - Check database file permissions

4. **Port already in use**
   - Change port in `app.py`: `app.run(port=5001)`
   - Or kill the process using port 5000
